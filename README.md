# Character Counts
The resources in this repository support the Berkeley Lit+DH working group's April 11, 2016 workshop on Python and NLTK.

This workshop draws inspiration from Professor David Bamman's recent talk to our group in which he described his research on automatic identification of film character types based on thousands of movie synopses. We will look at some of the methods he had employed, especially Named Entity Recognition (or NER), using tools made available by the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for Python, a popular programming language. In the process, we will learn some of the fundamentals of programming, such as using functions and implementing iterative loops. No previous knowledge of programming is required for this workshop. Although we will move quickly, there will be many exercises for practice.

The script that forms the backbone of this workshop is in the IPython Notebook format and requires the NLTK package.

IPython and NLTK are can be downloaded as part of the Anaconda platform here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads. (Select the version for Python 3.5)
